# 🎬 Exploratory Data Analysis on TDMb Movies  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores historical movie data from TDMb, focusing on trends in **production, revenue, and success factors**. Using Python and data analysis techniques, I examined patterns in budget, revenue, and return on investment (ROI) to uncover key insights.  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- 🎥 **Production Trends**: The number of movies produced has increased over time.  
- 💰 **Higher Budgets & Profits**: Higher production budgets **generally** lead to greater revenue, but with diminishing returns.  
- 📉 **Data Limitations**: Missing values and questionable budget figures affected the accuracy of ROI calculations.  

## 🎉 Conclusion  
> This study provides valuable insights into movie production trends, revenue, and success factors. However, the conclusions are limited by data quality, including missing values for budget and revenue.  
>  
> While trends suggest that **higher budgets tend to generate more profitability**, there’s no guaranteed formula for success. Common patterns emerge among top-performing films, but **true success depends on creativity, execution, and audience engagement.**
